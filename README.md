# Algorithmic Bioinformatics
Hi

So I am currently studying algorithmic bioinformatics online at the [Bioinformatics Insitute](https://bioinf.me/en).
To keep track of my knowledge I decided to write up the algorithms used, plus some explanation on how/why it works. This will also help me better understand the logic behind it all. 

Hopefully it will be useful to someone one day, as it was difficult for me to find accessible support on these algorithms when I was starting out.
